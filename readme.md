# !!!PROJECT SUNSET!!!!
I'm reworking my nvim config from scratch (instead of based off of a distro) at https://github.com/YilunAllenChen/nvim

Thank you AstroNvim for 15 awesome months! I'm really grateful to be able to work under its wings. Now that I'm more comfortable tinkering lua/nvim, I think it's time for me to bootstrap my nvim config from scratch.

I will no longer commit to this repo.
